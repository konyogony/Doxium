# Docs Theme

Nextra Docs Theme is a theme that includes almost everything you need to build a modern documentation website. It includes a top navigation bar, a search bar, a pages sidebar, a Table of Contents (TOC), and other built-in components.

This website itself is built with the Nextra Docs Theme.

# Quick Start from Template

## Deploy to Vercel

You can start by creating your own Nextra site and deploying to Vercel by clicking the [link](https://vercel.com/new/clone?s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2Fnextra-docs-template&showOptionalTeamCreation=false)


Vercel will fork the [Nextra Docs template](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template) and deploy the site for you. Once done, every commit in the repository will be deployed automatically.

## Fork the Template

You can also manually fork the [template repository](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template).

# Start as a New Project
<Timeline>
## Install

To create a Nextra Docs site manually, you have to install Next.js, React, Nextra, and Nextra Docs Theme. In your project directory, run the following command to install the dependencies:

<Tabs tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
```bash noTopBar
npm i next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-docs
```
```bash noTopBar
pnpm add next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-docs
```
```bash noTopBar
yarn add next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-docs
```
```bash noTopBar
bun add next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-docs
```
</Tabs>

<Alerts variant='warning'>
If you already have Next.js installed in your project, you only need to install `nextra` and `nextra-theme-docs` as the add-ons.
</Alerts>

Add the following scripts in `package.json`:

```json name='package.json'
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
},
```

You can start the server in development mode with the following command according to your package manager:
<Tabs tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
```bash noTopBar
npm run dev
```
```bash noTopBar
pnpm dev
```
```bash noTopBar
yarn dev
```
```bash noTopBar
bun run dev
```
</Tabs>

or in production mode:

<Tabs tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
```bash noTopBar
npm run build
npm start
```
```bash noTopBar
pnpm build
pnpm start
```
```bash noTopBar
yarn build
yarn start
```
```bash noTopBar
bun run build
bun run start
```
</Tabs>

<Alerts variant='warning'>
If youâ€™re not familiar with Next.js, note that development mode is significantly slower since Next.js compiles every page you navigate to.
</Alerts>

## Add Next.js Config

Create the following `next.config.mjs` file in your projectâ€™s root directory:

```js name='next.config.mjs'
import nextra from 'nextra'
 
const withNextra = nextra({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.jsx'
})
 
export default withNextra()
 
// If you have other Next.js configurations, you can pass them as the parameter:
// export default withNextra({ /* other next.js config */ })
```

With the above configuration, Nextra can handle Markdown files in your Next.js project, with the specified theme. Other Nextra configurations can be found in [Guide](https://nextra.site/docs/guide).

## Create Docs Theme Config

Lastly, create the corresponding `theme.config.jsx` file in your projectâ€™s root directory. This will be used to configure the Nextra Docs theme:

```jsx name='theme.config.jsx'
export default {
  logo: <span>My Nextra Documentation</span>,
  project: {
    link: 'https://github.com/shuding/nextra'
  }
  // ... other theme options
}
```

Full theme configurations can be found [here](https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration).

## Create Next.js [`App` Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app)

Create `pages/_app.jsx` file with the following content:

```jsx name='pages/_app.jsx'
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

## Ready to Go!

Now, you can create your first MDX page as `pages/index.mdx`:
```mdx name='pages/index.mdx'

# Welcome to Nextra
 
Hello, world!
```
And run the `dev` command specified in `package.json` to start developing the project! ðŸŽ‰

<Tabs tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
```bash noTopBar
npm run dev
```
```bash noTopBar
pnpm dev
```
```bash noTopBar
yarn dev
```
```bash noTopBar
bun run dev
```
</Tabs>

# Routing

Routing in Doxium is made entirely file-based, working similarly to Nextjs' one, without the need for specifically typing in the routes and their names.

## How it works?

First of all you have to specify your `base-url` parameter in doxium config - this will define where in your project structure you have your documentation. 
This option is usually set to `app/docs` or `app` by default (depending if you have chosen to use /docs folder during setup).
Then, in that directory you have just specified you can start by creating `page.mdx` files. The name for them will come from the parent directory.
To create a folder you can create a directory without a page.mdx file but contrianing other pages, then it will properly count as a folder.
> e.g. `about/page.mdx` yields a page with 'About' as its name. The pages are ordered by their 'path' and folders, so setting a custom order is out of luck for now.

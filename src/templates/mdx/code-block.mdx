# Code blocks

Code blocks are used to represent code in your documentation with proper highlighting. These code blocks are made using [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/),
therefore there are many themes to choose from, available by editing `"shiki-theme"` in `doxium.json`.

This is a built-in component, so it doesn't need to be imported from anywhere.

## Simple example:

Writing this:

````mdx
```tsx
const HelloWorld = () => console.log('Hello World!')
```
````

Will yield the following result on your page:

```tsx
const HelloWorld = () => console.log('Hello World!')
```

Notice that writing `tsx` after the backticks will define the language to be used for syntax highlighting. The list of available languages right now consists of:
- ts / js
- tsx / jsx
- rs
- html
- mdx
- bash
- sh
- css
- json

You can change the list of available languages by editing line **15** in `@/lib/highlighter.ts`. In the future, this will be more accessible via the `doxium.json` config.

# Advanced usage

Here are more of the advanced features available in Doxium's code blocks. You are able to combine all the topics to be discussed later, unlocking a creative potential.

## Code focus

You can make the reader focus on some part of the code by adding `// [!code focus]` after the line to make it not blurred. On hover, all the text will be revealed. 
You can also escape this by adding a backslash after the exclamation mark, `// [\!code focus]`

```json
{
    "theme": { 
        "shiki": "github-dark-dimmed" // [!code focus] 
    }
}
```

## Code highlight

You can highlight specific lines of code by adding `// [!code highlight]` after the line. This will make the whole line slightly white. This is fully customisable on line **125:127** in `@/app/globals.css`. 
Additionally, you can escape this by adding a backslash after the exclamation mark, `// [\!code highlight]`

```json
{
    "theme": { 
        "shiki": "github-dark-dimmed" // [!code highlight]  
    }
}
```

## Code deleted (--)

You can make specific lines of code red, as if deleted in `diff` mode, by adding `// [!code --]` after the line. This is fully customisable on line **120:122** in `@/app/globals.css`. 
Escapable by adding a backslash after the exclamation mark, `// [\!code --]`

```json
{
    "theme": { 
        "shiki": "github-dark-dimmed" // [!code --]  
    } // [!code --]  
}
```

## Code added (++)

You can make specific lines of code green, as if added in `diff` mode, by adding `// [!code ++]` after the line. This is fully customisable on line **116:118** in `@/app/globals.css`. 
Escapable by adding a backslash after the exclamation mark, `// [\!code ++]`

```json
{
    "theme": { 
        "shiki": "github-dark-dimmed" // [!code ++]  
    } // [!code ++]  
}
```

## Toggle top bar

You can toggle on/off the top bar in the code block which usually contains the icon, language and copy button. 
This is done by adding the `noTopBar` flag after declaring your language. For example, inputting this code:

````mdx
```json noTopBar
{
    "theme": { 
        "shiki": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```
````

Will result in this:

```json noTopBar
{
    "theme": { 
        "shiki": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```

### IRL example

```bash noTopBar
bunx doxium@latest init
```

## Toggle line numbers

You can toggle on/off the line numbers, which will be displayed in a darker tone to the left, by adding the `lineNumbers` flag after declaring your language.
For example, inputting this code:

````mdx
```json lineNumbers
{
    "theme": { 
        "shiki": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```
````

Will result you this:

```json lineNumbers
{
    "theme": { 
        "shiki": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```

## Toggle copy button

You can toggle on/off the copy button, although the user is still able to manually copy the text, by adding the `noCopyButton` flag after declaring your language.
For example, inputting this code:

````mdx
```json noCopyButton
{
    "theme": { 
        "shiki": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```
````

Will result you this:

```json noCopyButton
{
    "theme": { 
        "shiki": "github-dark-dimmed"
    } 
}
```


# Limitations and errors

In this section, I will discuss some limitations and errors that occur, which either will be fixed or have no fixes.

Summary:
| Issue | Notes |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| [[Shiki] 100+ instances have been created](#shiki-400-instances-have-been-created) | Development bug, build your app, `bun run build` |
| [Prettier moving // [!code highlight] to another line](prettier-moving-object-object-to-another-line) | Fixed by adding `.mdx` to `.prettierignore` |


If you are able to somehow fix any of these issues, make a [PR](https://github.com/konyogony/Doxium/pulls). Your contribution will be greatly appreciated :)


## [Shiki] 400 instances have been created

You may receive the following error (or a similar one) in the console when developing your app:

``[Shiki] 400 instances have been created. Shiki is supposed to be used as a singleton, consider refactoring your code to cache your highlighter instance; Or call `highlighter.dispose()` to release unused instances.``

This is a dev bug and is fixed when you properly build your app with `bun run build` and `bun run start`. 

To be honest, I am not sure why this happens in the dev environment either since I have made a singleton. Open to suggestions.


## Prettier moving `// [!code highlight]` to another line

This is a well-known error and issue by the Prettier community that it is able to move your comments to another line if it doesn't have space or meets some different parameters. 

Currently, I don't think there is a proper fix, so my solution is to add `.mdx` to `.prettierignore`, so that it doesn't format the file at all. This obviously comes at the cost that you have to manually format your file.

# Cards

You can use cards to give extra information to the reader or navigate him to a different page. You will first import the element from `doxium/docs-cards` and then use it as a React Element.
First, set the `title` property to your liking and then add content to the inside of the element. 

- You can set the `href` tag to make it clickable. 
- Additionaly you can set the `full` property to true to the have the card full width of the page.
- If you want to have the url open in a new tab you will have to set the `newTab` property to true.

## Examples

<DocsCards title={'Alerts'} href='/docs/features/alerts' newTab={true}>Check out alerts! They are used to attract attention and convey important information </DocsCards>
<DocsCards title={'Did you know?'}>Did you know, 1 developer has made all of this? But, with help from [PadowYT2](https://github.com/padowyt2) `test`</DocsCards>

```mdx
import DocsCards from 'doxium/docs-cards'

<DocsCards title={'Alerts'} href='/docs/features/alerts' newTab={true}>
    Check out alerts! They are used to attract attention and convey important information
</DocsCards>
<DocsCards title={'Did you know?'}>
    Did you know, 1 developer has made all of this? But, with help from [PadowYT2](https://github.com/padowyt2) `test`
</DocsCards>
``` 

> As you can see there is an issue with the hyperlink not getting highlighted, I have purposly decided not to solve it.

## Now with group

You can use DocsCardsGroup component to make a grid of cards, although dont forget to import it first from `doxium/docs-cards-group` <br />
You will have to set a `cols` propery - how many columns you want to have in the group. Rows are added automatically dependant on the columns.

<DocsCardsGroup cols={2}>
    <DocsCards title={'Alerts'} href='/docs/features/alerts'>Check out alerts! They are used to attract attention and convey important information</DocsCards>
    <DocsCards title={'Did you know?'}>Did you know, 1 developer has made all of this? But, with help from [PadowYT2](https://github.com/padowyt2)</DocsCards>
</DocsCardsGroup>

```mdx
import DocsCards from 'doxium/docs-cards'
import DocsCardsGroup from 'doxium/docs-cards-group'
<DocsCardsGroup cols={2}>
    <DocsCards title={'Alerts'} href='/docs/features/alerts'>
        Check out alerts! They are used to attract attention and convey important information
    </DocsCards>
    <DocsCards title={'Did you know?'}>
        Did you know, 1 developer has made all of this? But, with help from [PadowYT2](https://github.com/padowyt2)
    </DocsCards>
</DocsCardsGroup>
```

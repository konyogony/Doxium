# Code blocks

Code blocks are used to represent code in your documentation with highlighting and formatting.

```tsx
const Home = () => {
    return <h2>Home page</h2>;
};

export default Home;
```

You can edit the theme of this code block by changing the `shiki-theme` in `doxium.json` file, located at the root of your project.

```json
{
    "github-repo": "",
    "theme": {
        "shiki": "$SHIKI-THEME"
    }
}
```

The list of all available themes is (for now) available on this [website](https://textmate-grammars-themes.netlify.app/?theme=github-dark-dimmed&grammar=typescript)

I was able to implement support for all themes, aswell as automatic text colour change when using a light theme.
In the future I am looking forward to being able to customise:

-   Top bar
-   Copy button
-   Icons
-   Languages
-   Highlighting specific code

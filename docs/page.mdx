## Pros

This project was started in hopes of simplifying and modernizing the process of creating documentation. I have analyzed some of the common ways of creating documentation and have come up with a list of pros and cons.

- **App router**: Doxium uses [Next.js's app](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) router, which is a new model for building applications using React's latest features.
- **Customizable**: Doxium is highly customizable, allowing you to change the colors, themes & all components to fit your needs.
- **Raw components**: Doxium provides raw code for all the components, accessible right at your fingertips, which means you can easily modify each one of them uniqly.
- **Typescript**: Doxium is written and supports only [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), introducing type safety and better code quality.
- **Tailwindcss**: Doxium uses [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, which is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Cons

Since this project is new and still in its early stages, there are some cons that you should be aware of.

- **Limited frontmatter**: Currently, Doxium lacks a robust frontmatter system, essential for SEO and metadata.
- **No i18n support**: Doxium does not yet support multiple languages, but this feature is planned.
- **Poor light theme**: The light theme needs improvement to match the quality of the dark theme.
- **No versioning**: Documentation versioning is not yet supported, but it is on the roadmap.

In the future, I plan to fix these issues and make Doxium a great alternative for documentation generation out there.

## Goals

Main goal for Doxium is to give people an alternative to all other documentation tools out there, which are either too complex or too simple.
Doxium aims to be the perfect balance between the two, offering a simple and easy-to-use solution for creating modern documentation.

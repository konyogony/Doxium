# Automatic Installation

I highly recommend installing with our [CLI](/features/cli), since it is the easiest and fastest way to get started with Doxium. \
To get started, run the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']} sync={true}>

```bash noTopBar
npx doxium@latest init
```

```bash noTopBar
pnpm dlx doxium@latest init
```

```bash noTopBar
yarn dlx doxium@latest init
```

```bash noTopBar
bunx doxium@latest init
```

</Tabs>

It will prompt you the following questions:

```sh lineNumbers
? Name of your app: › my-app
? Would you like to use ESLint? › no / yes
? Would you like to use Prettier? › no / yes
? Would you like to use '/docs' folder? › no / yes
? Choose your shadcn style: ›
    New York
    Default
? Choose your base color (background, etc...): ›
    Stone
    Neutral
    Zinc
    Gray
    Slate
? Choose your accent color (buttons, hover, etc...): ›
  ↑ Orange
    Yellow
    Cyan
    Blue
    Indigo
  ↓ Pink
? Choose your code-block (shiki) theme: ›
  ↑ Dracula Theme Soft
    Everforest Dark
    GitHub Dark Default
    GitHub Dark Dimmed
    GitHub Dark High Contrast
  ↓ GitHub Light High Contrast
? GitHub repository URL (optional): ›
? Do you wish to proceed? › (Y/n)
```

After the installation process is complete, the CLI will create a directory with the name you provided and install all the necessary dependencies.

Then, you can navigate to the newly created directory and start the development server:

<Tabs tabs={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']} sync={true}>

```bash noTopBar
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

```bash noTopBar
cd my-app
pnpm dev
```

```bash noTopBar
cd my-app
yarn dev
```

```bash noTopBar
cd my-app
bun dev
```

</Tabs>

## FAQ

There are a few common questions about the installation process and the options available. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions:

<Accordion>

### What is ESLint?

ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

### What is Prettier?

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent code style across your entire codebase.

### What is Shadcn & their styles?

Shadcn is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. Don't worry about their styles, since I am planning to remove that option in the future

### What is Shiki & where can I find the themes?

Shiki is a beautiful syntax highlighter for code blocks. You can find all the theme previews [here](https://textmate-grammars-themes.netlify.app/)
